- Immutable classes, every modification of a state results in a new instance, thus concurrent threads can modify without using any synchronized block
- Immutable classes helps in writing more performable code in concurrent environment
- They are more suitable to be used as a key in HashMaps
- Implementing Cloneable(a marker interface) interface and clone() method does a shallow copy only by default
- To make a deep clone - each object's clone() method must be called and a new object must be constructed
- Deep copy of an object can be done using serialization - slow performance - all the nested objects must be serializable
