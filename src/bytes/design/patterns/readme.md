### SOLID
- **S**ingle Responsibility - The less the responsibility, the easier it is to modify the class
e.g. Logging class - should only be concerned about logging and not data persistence

- **O**pen/Closed Principle - Class should be open for extension but closed for modification - want to add feature - extend the class but not modify it.
Either use inheritance or polymorphism

- **L**iskov Substitution Principle -
